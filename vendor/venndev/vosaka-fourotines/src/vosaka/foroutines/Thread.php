     * The loop drives three subsystems on every tick:
     *   1. AsyncIO::pollOnce()  — non-blocking stream_select() across all
     *      registered read/write watchers; resumes fibers whose streams
     *      are ready (true async I/O in Dispatchers::DEFAULT context).
     *   2. WorkerPool::run()    — spawns child processes for Dispatchers::IO
     *      tasks up to the pool size limit.
     *   3. Launch::runOnce()    — dequeues one fiber from the cooperative
     *      scheduler queue, resumes it, and re-enqueues if still running.
     *
     * A small usleep is added on idle iterations (where none of the three
     * subsystems had actionable work) to avoid burning 100% CPU in a tight
     * busy-wait loop. This gives the OS scheduler time to advance child
     * processes and keeps idle CPU usage near zero — similar to how libuv
     * uses epoll/kqueue to sleep until an event arrives.
