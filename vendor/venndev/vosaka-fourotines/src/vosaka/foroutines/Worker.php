     *      closure serialization round-trip.
     *
     *   2. Otherwise (Windows, or pcntl not available), falls back to the original
     *      Process class which serializes the closure via SerializableClosure,
     *      writes it to shmop, and spawns `php background_processor_file.php`
     *      via symfony/process.
     *
